There's a bit of a story behind interfaces in Python.
The original attitude, which held sway for many years, is that you don't need them: Python works on the
EAFP (easier to ask forgiveness than permission) principle. That is, instead of specifying that you accept an,
I dunno, ICloseable object, you simply try to close the object when you need to, and if it raises an exception then
it raises an exception.

So in this mentality you would just write your classes separately, and use them as you will.
If one of them doesn't conform to the requirements, your program will raise an exception;
conversely, if you write another class with the right methods then it will just work, without your needing to specify
that it implements your particular interface.
